Exercise 1 Question 1 -- O(n^3) becuase n * n * n happens in the while logic
Exercise 1 Question 2 -- O(n^4) becuase the four levels of nested for loops would equate to n * n * n * n
Exercise 1 Question 3 -- I think this would equiate to O(n) because the logic lessens it by 1 every time creating a linear relationship  

Exercise 2
